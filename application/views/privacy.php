                        <p>We understand the importance of privacy to our customers and visitors to Justlog web sites. For many years, our policy has been to treat what we learn about our customers as confidential. For example, we will not give or sell confidential or Personal Information (as described below) about our customer to any third party not affiliated with their transaction, except as required by law or as necessary to provide Justlog services to the customer. </p>
                        <p>We collect and store information about every package we handle so that we can efficiently provide the package delivery services demanded by our customers. We use information about our customers, their packages, and their shipping activity to provide or enhance the services we make available to our customers, communicate with our customers about additional services they may find of value, satisfy our legitimate business interests (including performing trend analysis and market studies), set prices, establish credit, fulfill a Contract of Carriage or Service Agreement, accomplish the billing function, and comply with government regulations. Although government regulations vary in the many countries in which we operate, they frequently include the reporting of information to transportation, safety, customs, and other regulatory agencies. As we collect and use information about our customers, we may contract with vendors to assist us in processing that information for those purposes listed in the previous paragraph. These vendors are required to maintain the confidentiality of the information and are restricted from using the information for any other purpose. In addition, as Justlog continues to develop its business, we may buy or sell subsidiaries or business units. As part of these transactions, customer information of the subsidiaries or business units may be one of the transferred assets.</p>
                        <p>We treat our data as assets that must be protected against loss and unauthorized access. We employ information security techniques to appropriately protect confidential information from unauthorized access by users inside and outside the company. Access to customer information is limited to those employees who have a legitimate business need for that information.</p>
                       
                        <h2 class="m-t30 m-b10 ">Customers are Responsible for Protecting Information and Systems on their Premises</h2>
                        <p>Some information about Justlog customers and their packages is stored in shipping systems located on customer premises. Customers concerned about the security of their information in these systems should secure it by activating passwords and using physical access controls. When these systems (hardware or software) are provided by Justlog, we provide tools to facilitate customer efforts to safeguard their information. </p>
                        <h2 class="m-t30 m-b10 ">Cookies </h2>
